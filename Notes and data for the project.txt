Data that we are going to store about the customer 
(revised list) 
-Car plate number 
-Car model 
-Customer first and last name 
-Customer payment type ( cash or credit ) 
-generated ticket number 
- Pricing based on how many hours they want it 
(1 dollar per one hour, max of 12 hours for just vistors) 
(18 dollar for lost ticket pricing) 
(pricing for 1 month block time, 3 month, 6 months, 12 months) 
(1 month = $236.20- $245) ( This can be swapped to any number tbh) ( Just the average amount I saw while doing research based on philly area unless your looking at something like logan sqaure thats like $500)As for the 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months we can go with soemthing like a 10, 15, 20 percent discount since the time durations are longer 
For example: 
 3 months = 661.5 with a 10 percent discount using the base of 245 ( still need some profit)
6 months = 1249.50 
12 months = 2400 with a base price of 250 and the 20% discount 
(discount only applied with a membership fee) 
-membership fee gives 10% off regular parking up to 12 hours
price of that would be like = $35 per month? <- this could be changed to anything tbh.
